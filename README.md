# aom-paper-matching

This is part of my effort in creating a dataset for studying the process of knowledge creation via scientists' collaboration, particularly the antecedents of collaboration performance.

In order to measure collaboration performance, we start with using papers presented at the 2001-2014 Academy of Management (AOM) conferences. Because the key purpose of the conferences is for scientists to share their research ideas and on-going projects, the bar for paper acceptance at the AOM conferences is relatively lower than that at related top-tier journals. Therefore, I use AOM conference papers to capture scientists' collaboration and journal papers to capture successful collaboration.

To identify successful collaboration, I am required to match AOM conference papers to journal papers. Matched AOM conference papers indicate successful collaborations. Unmatched AOM conference papers indicate unsuccesful collaborations.
